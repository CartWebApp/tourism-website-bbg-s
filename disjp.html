                    The Japanese love to hold festivals and there are some festivals 
                    that would be very entertaining for all ages. One example is the 
                    Nagasaki Lantern Festival started out as a way to celebrate the new 
                    years, but in 1994 it turned into what is now the Lantern Festival. 
                    Over 15,000 lanterns will paint the town during the 15 day festival. 
                    There are many types of dances performed during the celebration. One 
                    example of these dances is the Chinese Lion Dance. This event is the 
                    second most viewed tradition in Japan. Lanterns are set afloat on the 
                    water to signify us, “going back to our elements.” Visitors are welcomed 
                    to this festival, and it's easy for them to participate as well. They are 
                    able to participate by making their own lantern, or they can buy one from 
                    the numerous shops around. These festivities make the festival fun and interactive 
                    allowing anyone to enjoy the Lantern Festival.

                    One of the strangest cultural traditions celebrated in Japan would be KFC on Christmas Eve.  
                    In 1974, KFC launched a Christmas ad campaign called, “kentucky for christmas.” These ads 
                    allowed KFC to start to be viewed in a more elegant, authentic way in Japan. KFC would deliver 
                    the chicken to houses in a Santa costume making the franchise rise extremely high in popularity 
                    during this time of year. Although it can be difficult to partake in this event, during this 
                    time of year, there is a KFC Christmas Special. This special allows patrons to place an order 
                    weeks in advance, or face standing in line for hours. Lots of people view this event as more of 
                    something along the lines of valentines day. An occasion of bringing a bucket of chicken to share 
                    with loved ones. So if you ever happen to be in Japan consider getting a bucket of chicken for 
                    someone special in your life.
